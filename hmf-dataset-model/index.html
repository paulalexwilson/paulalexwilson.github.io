            <a>Datasets</a> provide a means for capturing and representing production, contextual and provenance
            information alongside the HMF tree metadata itself in such a way that it can be independently
            processed by user interfaces, storage subsystems and event streams.
        </p>
        <p>
            Datasets are <em>flattened</em> representations of HMF resource graphs, so it is up to the client
            to frame them into a nested structure of their choosing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Datasets used the concept of <a>named graphs</a> to capture supplementary information about
            a metadata tree. Named graphs paritition data into well-defined and unambigous graphs which
            can be independently processed or merged into a consolidate graphs as needed by downstream
            systems either programmatically or using <a>frames</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            HMF <a>resources</a> (nodes, properties, types, namespaces and so on) are identified using an IRI
            and multiple graphs may supply information about the same resource using that IRI.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            HMF datasets act as general purpose containers of HMF metadata for storage and transmission.
            They solve several problems:
            <ul>
                <li>Partitioning Data</li>
                <li>Describing Changesets</li>
                <li>...</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The HMF base representation is flattened.
